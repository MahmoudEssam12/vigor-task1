# The First Task (E2E CRUD APP)

After colning the repositry cd to backend folder and type command
```
docker-compose up 
```
it will install the packages and run the server on localhost://8080

it's REST API so after running the server open the index.html file in frontend folder.

- you will find a form to add new users
after submitting the form data will be added in the table
- each row has edit column it has two buttons one to enable editing and the other for deleting the user.
- clicking on edit button will make another button appear next to it that for saving the updates.


i decided to make the frontend with native javascript to show you my skills in js ... it was easier using any JS framework i hope you like it.

### note : the design is not the best but that beacause i focused on the logic and the backend too much so i ran out of time
